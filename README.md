## CSVPARSE
So I have a csv file, and it has quote delimination, eg:
  one,two,"with , comma",four

There are a million examples of baroque regex strings to parse these, but I couldn’t seem to get any of them to work. So I wrote a small bit of code to parse each line.

Essentially pass each line into this code as a string, and it returns an array of values. Sorry for the bad spacing, wordpress y’all.
